## Arrays and Loops; Multiples drawing
### Inspiration
This array project was inspired by the visual style of the game [Vib-Ribbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vib-Ribbon). In our workshops a lot of our intial work used simple shapes and lines to do artwork. This reminded me of how that game was designed, so decided to recreate an artwork based on that game into this project.

### Technical understanding

This was well suited for arrays because I could create an *array* listing coordinates of different points. From there, a repeating loop drew from point to point from the array of points. 

It generates differently every time you reload the page as the points get offset randomly. Notice the tiny details!
