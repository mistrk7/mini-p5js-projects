# Drawing Pattern

I created this design in Visual Studio Code and used P5JS plugins to view it live as I wrote. I have past experience in VS Code and JavaScript, so writing the program wasn't too difficult for me. 

I used the [P5JS reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to figure out how to generate shapes using the correct syntax and format. The VS code plugin helped describe the  operation of each input in the function commands, as it gave me an in-line description of its function.

I considered making both designs on the same page, but I ran out of time. This project was very fun to do.
