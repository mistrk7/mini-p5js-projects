# Variable Generative Art

For my generative art I used variables based on the position of the mouse, sine waves, and the distance a circle has to the position of the mouse. First I created a grid of circles that changed size depending on how close the mouse was. Then I added extra effects such as colouring and waving using sine functions.

I don't know what this is supposed to be. a colourful, rippling pond maybe?
