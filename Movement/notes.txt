First, declare a variable
A variable is a placeholder for storing values.

Let = A variable that will change
Const = Creates a variable that is able to be changed.

--
let myNewVAriable = 22;
const anotherVariable = 100; 

// Don't use var: 
var anOldVariable = 85; 
--

Don't use var. Var was phased out. 

Concatenating = combining value types in console.log()
ex. console.log(abc+"def")

CODE PROMPT FOR THIS WEEK:

Create a piece of generative art inspired by this weeks content 
(brushes, randomisation, strokes, variables)

Write comments in code and create a README.md file to describe the project.
Have a look at different input and output variables to play around for a custom visual output 
Have a look at the examples on notion
