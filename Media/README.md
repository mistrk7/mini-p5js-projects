# Photos on desk

In this sketch I used media products. It is a lot larger in size than the other sketches beacause i've integrated photography. It was inspired by some photographs that were left on my desk when I walked into my room last night.

Click on each photo to 'slide' it closer to you and get a better look. A sliding paper sound is played when you do this. 

To me the main purpose of this project was to utilise Classes and object-oriented programming stuff. Each 'photo' is its own class, which makes it easy to copy the same object many times over again with different images in them. I couldn't get the image to move atop of one another as you click on them as the layering was pre-decided.
